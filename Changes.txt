=======

Vr. 2.0.4.0 () (HSR)
- Chg: As date you also could give ','; '.'; '-'; '\'; '/'
       Examples: 20-11-2002  20.11.2002  20/11/2002
- Chg: Layout of GUI. Now you can change groups and dates to 
       search/make stats immidiatelly. Also now it's the same date-edit.
       Now quick-selections are made by menu.
       (Delete: Change name to '' (nothing))
- Add: Find-In: "Return" (#13) begins the search
- Fix/Add: "Folding" of Headers (Bugfixes)
- Add: "Browsing": If checked you can "browse" through groups with findable 
       string. Every single group clicked will be searched for given string.
- 2Do: FindBegin/FindEnd changing, 'cause not all things are in 
       tabbednotebook anymore...
Note: *Please* don't click on groups or on the panel with times while you're 
      searching, because that's not disabled yet!

(Alpha-Fix: Keys had commands on it, so it wasn't usefull)
- Add: Support for a DLL to use the Hamster-Database itself in Sourcecode.
       It's written by Klaus Ketelaer. *THANKS*. :-)
       Perhaps you'll need a VB-Runtime for using the DLL.
       To switch the DLL on you have to change in Source "UseDll" to true 
       and recompile. (ObjArt: tAgtArt.Create)

For some reason the whole thing doesn't work. Don't know how to fix/chage it.
I'll ask one.
